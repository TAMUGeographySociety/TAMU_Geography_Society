# FME Introduction Course:

### Program: Feature Manipulation Engine (FME)
FME is a software created by Safe Software, a company based out of Canada. FME is a data integration platform with the best support for spatial data worldwide. With FME you can automate your data integration workflows and distribute your data to those who need it so you can spend more time using your data, and less time fighting it.

Make sure you are only installing FME Desktop 2019.1 - 64 bit for 64 bit computers, 32 bit for 32 bit computers.

**It is IMPORTANT to have ArcGIS (ArcMap or ArcPro) installed on your computer before you install FME**

Once you get to the licence assistance, you will want to pick up a floating license. I will provide this floating license during our first meeting, so if you've made it this far, then that's all you need to do before I start teaching.

Q/A
1. Which version do you recommend?
    * I will be working with the FME 2019 version but if you already have 2018 installed, you will be fine.
2. Do I need a Windows device to use FME?
    * Nope! FME works on Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems.
3. Do I need to know how to code to take this course?
    * No coding knowledge is needed to use FME
4. I have another question!

## Data:
We will be using a CSV file to start us off that contains some wellbore data.

[Click here to download the CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TAMUGeographySociety/TAMU_Geography_Society/master/Learning/Week1/BorestickData.csv)

Hit Ctrl+S on the page and save it to your computer ... or I will show a way to scrape it directly from the internet during the lesson.

## What we are doing:
During this first course I will be teaching the basics of FME and how to use it. I will be using an example of something I did this summer at my time in the oil and gas industry that is simple enough for a beginner level understanding of the program. Those that are advanced in FME may still benifit from coming as they will get experience with oil and gas and FME processes.
