# Introduction Pt. 2

#### Haven't installed FME yet? [Go look here.](../../Learning/Week1)

### So what are we doing this week?
We are going to be re-introducing FME and practicing a little more on some of the basic stuff, but this time we will be reading a dynamic dataset using wildcards "*".
>
A wildcard is a reading special character that basically reads all files in a given folder. We will be using that to read our 2 Lidar Datasets.
>
The goal of this lab will be to create 3D representations of College Station Buildings from LIDAR and a CS Structures .shp file. 

## Data
In this situation we will be working with .shp and LIDAR data. You can find the 2 datasets here:
#### NOTE: Keep all of your downloads in 1 folder as we will be dynamically reading our data this week
