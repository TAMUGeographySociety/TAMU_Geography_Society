# CADdy Shack - An AutoCAD Workshop

Welcome to CAddy Shack, where we'll be going over AutoCAD and how it applies to our lives as GIS professionals.

### What is CAD?
CAD, which stands for Computer Aided Design, is software used to create precision drawings and technical illustrations. CAD can create 2D, such as floorplans for buildings, or 3D models, as full building models.
#### CAD Programs:
- MicroStation (Bentley Systems)
- AutoCAD (Autodesk)
- CorelCAD (Corel)
- SolidWorks Premium (SolidWorks)

But for today's lesson, we're focusing on one of the more popular CAD softwares, AutoCAD. 

#### Autodesk's AutoCAD
While Autodesk offers an abundance of CAD, Building Information Model (BIM), and even GIS softwares, we will be focusing on the basic AutoCAD software. This allows us to open all dwg files, inspect the elements, and make any edits needed. Luckily, students can download AutoCAD for free. 

[Get a student license here and Download](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/autocad) - Choose the Create Account 

Once you're signed in, you should be able to download the software ([AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/autocad#)). Make sure to download the correct version (AutoCAD 2020), operating system option (32- or 64-Bit) *NOTE: AutoCAD 2020 only runs in 64-Bits. If your computer is 32-bits, feel free to download AutoCAD 2019* and language (English).

--Please make sure to do this before the CADdy Shack Workshop--

### Project

While the lesson is still being put together, you can play around with the software before CADdy Shack and create a football field. The dimensions can be found [here](https://www.courtdimensions.net/football-field/)
