## **RESUME**
- General Tips: 
  - GPA is _not_ required on the resume. Good rule of thumb, only include it if you have 3.5+
  - Only include skills you're 101% prepared to demostrate at your interview or on your first day. 
  - Utilize action verbs in you job description. 
  - Unless you have 10+ years of experience, keep your resume to one page. Anything extra can go in your cover letter. 
  - Rewrite your resume for every application. Make it specific to that job description
