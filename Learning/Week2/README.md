# FME Introduction Course Pt. 2

#### Haven't installed FME yet? [Go look here.](../../Learning/Week1)

## So what are we doing this week?
We are going to be re-introducing FME and practicing a little more on some of the basic stuff. We are going to continue in the 3D realm, so put your data-visualization pants on as we dive head-first into some 3D math.

The goal of this lab will be to create 3D representations of College Station Buildings from LIDAR and a CS Structures .shp file. 

## Data
In this situation we will be working with .shp and LIDAR data. You can find the 2 datasets here:
